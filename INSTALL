Assume that HSRED and its associated libraries have been downloaded
into your ${HOME}/idl directory.  Define the following environment
variables in your ~/.cshrc file:

	setenv HSRED_DIR     ${HOME}/idl/hsred

Now make sure that ${HOME}/idl is in your local IDL path.  In your
~/.cshrc file add the line

	source /usr/local/rsi/idl/bin/idl_setup
	setenv IDL_PATH         +${HOME}/idl/:/usr/local/rsi/idl/lib

Note: it important that both the {HOME}/idl (this distribution) and the IDL
built in tasks are included in the path.  You should be sure that the 
directory above is the correct path for the IDL libraries. The same is true 
for the setup script


Now, you will need to install idlspec2d and idlutils.  The tar balls are 
with hsred.

 Add the following lines to your .cshrc file (or equiv) assuming you unpacked
	these in the idl directory

	
	setenv IDLUTILS_DIR $HOME/idl/idlutils-v5_0_0
	setenv IDLSPEC2D_DIR $HOME/idl/idlspec2d-v5_0_0
        setenv  PATH $IDLUTILS_DIR/bin:$IDLSPEC2D_DIR/bin:$PATH
  	setenv IDL_PATH +$IDLUTILS_DIR/goddard/pro:$IDL_PATH
  	setenv  IDL_PATH +$IDLUTILS_DIR/pro:$IDL_PATH
        setenv IDL_PATH +$IDLSPEC2D_DIR/pro:$IDL_PATH'
	setenv DUST_DIR $HOME/idl/hsred/dust
Some caveats:

	As of June 8, The wavelength solution blueward of about 3900 AA is a bit off.  Redshifts are only fit from 3800 in the reduce1d pipeline, and the mistake is minimual from 3800-3900, but it shoudl be noted.
DLSPEC2D_DIR/pro:$IDL_PATH

Now, source your .cshrc file. Now we can build the code

	 cd $IDLUTILS_DIR
  	 evilmake all
  	 cd $IDLSPEC2D_DIR
  	 evilmake all

THis is EXTREMELY important!!!!

IDL is not a good program if it uses all of the available memory on your system
IT WILL CRASH YOUR SYSTEM REQUIRING A HARD REBOOT.  The best way to stop this
from happening is to limit the amount of memory available to your machine.

Currently, I run a 1 Gb RAM machine and I limit it as follows:

cputime         unlimited
filesize        unlimited
datasize        921600 kbytes
stacksize       921600 kbytes
coredumpsize    0 kbytes
memoryuse       921600 kbytes
vmemoryuse      unlimited
descriptors     1024
memorylocked    unlimited
maxproc         7168

Under these conditions, if IDL wants more memory than available, it will
and error message and end instead of taking the computer down.
In order to limit these, I include the following lines in my .cshrc
 #Limit my cache sizes
limit datasize 900m
limit stacksize 900m
limit memoryuse 900m
limit coredumpsize 0


There have been incidents where the limits were set, and the memory was
overrun.  This was most likely caused by a screen saver using available
memory.  I would recommend changing the screen savor the blank screen.
